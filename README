Django-dev-cms is a small and minimalist cms designed, as the name says, for
developers who have a basic knowledge of the django template engine, his tags
and filters, some kind of html and a little bit of css.

It reads templates and stylesheets (css) direct from the database, instead of 
from the filesystem.

It requires mptt (https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/), so install it
before install django-dev-cms.

To install django-dev-cms, download and unzip the dev-cms folder in a place
inside the PYTHON PATH, a folder called devcms, for example.

To use django-dev-cms, follow the next simple steps: 

1) In settings.py modify the following keys:

TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
    'devcms.db_loader.load_template_source',
    ...
)

...

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'mptt',
    'devcms',
)


2) In urls.py add the following url patterns:

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...

    # Read stylesheets (css) from database
    (r'(.*)\.css$', 'devcms.views.load_css'),

    ...

    # Try to find a cms page. It must be the last pattern
    (r'(.*)', 'devcms.views.direct_to_cms'),
)

3) Go to the admin area and create templates (pages) and stylesheets.
